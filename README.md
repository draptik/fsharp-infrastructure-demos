# F# infrastructure demos

What do I mean by "infrastructure"? Everything that is not directly related to functional
programming. F.ex. "howto setup a simple web application with database connection", "howto add
authentication to a web app", etc. Many demos are either outdated, or only cater to windows users.

Demo applications showcasing how to use F# in different scenarios.

- web
- database access
- authentication, authorization, IdentityServer
- package management (NuGet, Paket)
- build process (MSBuild, FAKE)
- deployment (Farmer)
- etc

## Goal

Everything should work with

- dotnet core 5
- linux
- cli and/or Rider
